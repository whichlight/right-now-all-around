right now all around
====================

Play with the app here: http://whichlight.com/seetheworld/

This app is a way to view recent public instagram posts, with the option to
retweet posts you like.

There is no filtering of the posts, it is just a sample of all the images posted
most recently. The result is a tool of serendipity and exploration. What I find
compelling is the juxtaposition of so many different captured experiences.  

In some cases people who shared photos only had 100 or 200 followers to see
them.  Now many more can see, share, and comment on the photos. 

Instagram made it easier for people to take beautiful photos.  right now all
around builds on
that enabled creativity by creating a collective image stream.  In a way the result is
visual poetry of what people are doing, feeling, or wanting to remember.

The time of day plays a roll- if you look at the app at 4 AM EST for instance,
you will see more photos from southeast asia.

In the non-mobile version elapsed time is presented.  Usually as you scroll
down, you are looking at older bits of content. In this case, with every API
call, new images are brought up.  If you refresh, you will only see new images.
The app is always looking forward, and there is no memory.

I used this as an opportunity to play with the backbone js framework, building a
client side app with JSONP from the Twitter API.
